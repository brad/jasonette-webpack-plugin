# Jasonette Webpack Plugin

The Jasonette Webpack plugin aims to take some of the pain out of writing JSON for [Jasonette](https://jasonette.com/). With this plugin, your JSON is just an export of a JavaScript object. Some of the benefits you get with this approach:

- You can use comments
- No need to quote object properties
- You can use single quotes for strings
- Object values are automatically converted to strings
- You can use trailing commas
- Functions are automatically exported for use in Jasonette templates
- Automatic minification of your JSON, which can reduce the file size by a lot
- Access to the whole node ecosystem

Example usage coming soon!
